LIT UP

Grid of squares. Aim of the game is to switch off all the lights.

Must have a clickable grid 
Board must load with some pre-determined squares on the grid displayed as lit.
Each click will toggle the style of the clicked element - and also the styles of the four immediately abutting elements.
After each click will check to determine if a win has been achieved
Must display the number of clicks used in that round
Once a round has been completed, after a short delay will load the next round


I began my javascript and wrote two vanilla functions to select all the boxes and then add event listeners to them.
Then wrote one single line of jQuery that did the exact same thing.
